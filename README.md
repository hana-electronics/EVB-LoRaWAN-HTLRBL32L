  The EvB LoRa board was developed with the purpose of enabling easy access to the input and output pins of the iMCP-HTLRBL32L-10 component from HT Micron. This component is a System-in-Package (SiP) that has communication capabilities using the LoRa and BLE protocols. The component integrates a BlueNRG SoC microprocessor from ST Microelectronics with Bluetooth LE interface and an RF transceiver from Semtec with a multi-region LoRaWAN interface.o.
